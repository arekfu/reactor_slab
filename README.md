# Slab Reactor Toy Models

---

## Description of System

The system which I have chosen to build this toy model around is a slab reactor, which is infinite in two dimensions, and finite along the x axis, with vacuum at either end of the reactor. The reactor itself is composed of a core which is a multiplying medium, and a reflector at either side which is non-multiplying. A depiction of this system along the x axis is presented below.
