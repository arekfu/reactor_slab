# Slab Reactor Toy Models

---

## Description of System

The system which I have chosen to build this toy model around is a slab reactor, which is infinite in two dimensions, and finite along the x axis, with vacuum at either end of the reactor. The reactor itself is composed of a core which is a multiplying medium, and a reflector at either side which is non-multiplying. A depiction of this system along the x axis is presented below.

The two group approximation is used in these programs, with the assumption of isotropic scattering for the moment. the cross sections for each material at each energy are provided in tables bellow (with scattering matrices).
